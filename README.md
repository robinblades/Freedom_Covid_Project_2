Freedom of Choice and Covid-19 Cases By Country in 2021

Goal: 

To investigate the relationship between freedom of choice and covid-19 cases.

Data: 

Freedom to make life choices is measured by the World Happiness Report every year. (Data on Kraggle.) I downloaded the 2019, 2020, and 2021 reports.

Freedom of choice is estimated based on a sample of 1,000 citizens from each country, and thus may not be representational. It is also based on one single binary question: "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?"

Covid-19 cases are reported by worldometers. 


Covid-19 cases may not always be accurately reported. Many countries are overwhelmed by sick citizens and accurate records may be difficult to attain.

Analysis:

I downloaded and merged the World Happiness Report files from 2019, 2020, and 2021. I then took a subset of freedom scores for each country. Then I downloaded the Covid-19 data and merged that file with the freedom data. I then created a new file to graph a scatter plot and line graph to investigate trends between freedom of choice and covid-19 deaths.
